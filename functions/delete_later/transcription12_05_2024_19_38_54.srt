Hey everyone, welcome Back to the channel.05

2
00:00:04,273 --> 00:00:08,049
did you know the average human brain can generate enough electricity

3
00:00:08,137 --> 00:00:09,805
to power a light bulb?

4
00:00:10,265 --> 00:00:14,089
00:10 Seriously, like a tiny little light

5
00:00:14,137 --> 00:00:17,729
bulb inside your head. 00:15 I know,

6
00:00:17,777 --> 00:00:19,521
right? Mind blowing.

7
00:00:19,673 --> 00:00:23,393
00:20 this amazing biological marvel is

8
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:26,923
constantly processing information, forming memories,

9
00:00:26,979 --> 00:00:29,187
and controlling your every movement.

10
00:00:29,371 --> 00:00:32,731
00:25 It's a supercomputer.

11
00:00:32,923 --> 00:00:36,507
00:30 so next time you feel overwhelmed,

12
00:00:36,691 --> 00:00:40,215
remember that your brain is truly an incredible machine.

13
00:00:40,515 --> 00:00:43,747
00:35 and for today's video, that is

14
00:00:43,771 --> 00:00:47,411
