3
00:00:06,993 --> 00:00:09,913
15, 000 times a day?

4
00:00:10,089 --> 00:00:13,841

00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:17,361

for eye health. 0018 it helps spread

00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:32,019
tears across the surface, washing away irritants

10
00:00:32,187 --> 00:00:34,091
and keeping the eye moist.

11
00:00:34,283 --> 00:00:37,859
00:22 it also helps prevent the cornea

12
00:00:37,907 --> 00:00:40,215
from drying out and becoming damaged.

13
00:00:40,795 --> 00:00:44,083
