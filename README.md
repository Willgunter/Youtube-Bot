# Youtube-Bot
A bot that creates shorts content and automatically uploads them to platforms

checklist:
    - integrate with google gemini for script âœ…
    - use gtts for text-to-speech âœ…
    - use something better (elevenLabs) for text-to-speech (check)
    iuse 
    - switch from using assemblyai / cmu library phonemes to gentle phoneme timings
        - add timing stuff for all phonemes from cmudict not just the first one
        - also handle case of "undefined (like a period or something)" for cmudict transcription stuff
        - while using cmu library, handle undefined logic (like if it is a certain length or longer, make it generate visemes randomly)
    - editing
        - combine speech + audio into a video âœ…
        - crop video to 16:9 or whatever âœ…
            I find a source of videos
        - figure out how to fetch random clips + validate they are Creative Commons certified ðŸŸ¨
        - edit video (idk what specific things)
    - figure out how to edit video really well for viewer engagement (stretch goal if this ends up working)
    - add subtitles âœ…
    - upload to youtube
    - figure out deployment with GCP
    - break up steps between different gcp cloud functions (in same file) so one does not do all the work (after I am done with main stuff though)
    - either get rid of addSubtitlesToVideos or do it through ZapCap (want to do it through subtitles but thats not super important and something for the future)
    - organize code (add / remove comments, move variable initiation around, remove unneeded imports, etc...)
    - add error handling / retry login / phone text if it goes wrong (in the future)

current problems / todos:
    - finish with captions
        - start looking around for a place for creative commons vertical videos I can use

commands:

    // runs locally
    // run from root of project?
    - (in functions) firebase emulators:start
    - (in functions) yt-dlp -o "./videos/fall_guys.(%ext)s" -f bestvideo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGSsgACIc6Q
        - (downloads fall guys video w/ best video quality (background audio is not necessary rn))


TODO: (for self) eventually export setup / admin / other firebase stuff to utils
- also tailor gemini prompt + tailor properties and stuff (look bat at like 69 in createScript.js idk what that does)
- or figure out how to put sources in description of video (using generationConfig from gemini api) (https://ai.google.dev/api/generate-content?_gl=1*3prpvu*_up*MQ..&gclid=CjwKCAjw1NK4BhAwEiwAVUHPUB06YslWhuNcHUGpG1kNYBUnoGh8LmaDMJEBoQ3TG48MmRPC0W5pFBoCWaoQAvD_BwE#v1beta.GenerationConfig)
also useful commands are in variousstuff.js file
- generate speech using better text to speech thing
